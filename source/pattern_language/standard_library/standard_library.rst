Standard Library
================

The Pattern Language Standard Library is a set of utility functions and intrinsics to interact with ImHex or the currently loaded data.

.. note::

   To use the Standard Library, it first needs to be installed. The easiest way to do that is through the Content Store under ``Help -> Content Store``.
   Select the ``Libraries`` tab and install ``std`` from there.
